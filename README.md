# TELEKINESIS
🎯 Project Context
An interactive, Arduino-powered RC car designed for children at the Boston Children’s Museum. Controlled via an IR remote, this car integrates motor control, sensor feedback, and real-time data tracking for an engaging hands-on experience. This project was part of the “Superhero Academy” at the Boston Children’s Museum’s Fun Labs! event. I collaborated with 7 teams to build a cohesive exhibit focused on value-sensitive design and STEM education. Over 100 children interacted with our installations.

🔧 Features
IR Remote Control – Navigate the car using an IR sensor and programmable remote input.
Optimized Motor Response – Enhanced L298N H-Bridge logic for a 30% improvement in speed and responsiveness.
Motion Tracking – Integrated IMU captures orientation and movement data.
Data Visualization – MATLAB scripts generate live plots for velocity, position, and acceleration.
Obstacle Detection – Ultrasonic sensor detects nearby objects.
Custom Chassis – SolidWorks-designed, 3D-printed body for durability and clean component integration.
